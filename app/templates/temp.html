      <h2>Step 1: Registration</h2>
      <p>Before we start, let's create a registration system for users to enroll their faces. In this section, we'll guide you through the process of capturing and storing facial images for recognition.</p>

    <!-- Generating Image Section -->
    <section class="my-5">
      <h2>Step 2: Generating Image</h2>
      <p>In this step, we'll generate an image to showcase the process of capturing an image for recognition purposes. We'll use this image for testing our face recognition system later.</p>
