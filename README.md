# face-recognition-flask-python-attendance
**Description of this Project**
* Face recognition attendance and scanning temperature using Arduino micro controller (Hardware) and Python programming language (Software).
1. Hardware Materials:
   * Arduino Uno Board
   * 9 Volts Battery with holder
   * Bluetooth module H06
   * Buzzer & Switch
   * MLX90614 - IR Temperature Sensor
3. Software Requirements:
   * Python (Flask, OpenCV, Pandas)
   * MySQL (Storage Requirements)
   * HTML, CSS, Javascript (Website User Interface)
   * C++ (Arduino Language)

<br> *Note: It should have an Arduino port for temperature otherwise system wouldn't function.*
